Project Title:
Product Line Profitability & Margin Performance Analysis for Nassau Candy Distributor

Problem Statement:
For distributors like Nassau Candy, high sales volume does not always translate into high profitability. Several products generate strong revenue but operate at low margins due to high manufacturing or operational costs. Without clear visibility into product-level and division-level profitability, business decisions related to pricing, sourcing, and product portfolio optimization remain reactive.

This project addresses the lack of insight into true profit drivers and margin risk across product lines.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze sales, cost, and profit data to:
• Identify products that genuinely drive profitability
• Detect high-revenue but low-margin products
• Compare revenue and profit efficiency across divisions
• Analyze profit concentration and dependency risks
• Provide data-driven recommendations for margin optimization

Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning & Validation  
   - Verified sales, cost, and profit values  
   - Removed invalid zero-sales and missing unit records  
   - Standardized division and product labels  

2. Profitability Metric Calculation  
   - Gross Margin (%)  
   - Profit per Unit  
   - Revenue Contribution  
   - Profit Contribution  

3. Product-Level Analysis  
   - Ranked products by gross profit and margin  
   - Identified high-sales, low-margin risk products  

4. Division-Level Performance Analysis  
   - Compared revenue vs profit contribution across divisions  
   - Identified structurally weak margin divisions  

5. Profit Concentration (Pareto) Analysis  
   - Analyzed dependency on a small number of products for overall profit  

6. Visualization & Dashboarding  
   - Developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard for dynamic analysis  

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit, GitHub

Key Insights:
• A small percentage of products contribute the majority of total profit, indicating profit concentration risk  
• Several high-revenue products operate at low margins and require pricing or cost optimization  
• Certain divisions generate strong sales but underperform in profit contribution  
• Loss-making products were identified for immediate strategic review  

Strategic Recommendations:
• Reprice high-sales, low-margin products to improve unit economics  
• Renegotiate manufacturing or sourcing costs for margin-poor products  
• Review consistently loss-making products for discontinuation  
• Reduce dependency on a limited number of profit-driving products  

Outcome:
The project delivers a profitability-focused analytical framework that enables management to move beyond sales volume and make informed, margin-driven business decisions. The interactive dashboard supports real-time exploration of product and division performance.

Conclusion:
This analysis demonstrates how data-driven profitability insights can enhance financial efficiency, reduce margin risk, and support sustainable business growth.
